			 Space 1. Yep, here we are at a literal parking ramp. The busiest parking spot in downtown Iowa City. But here we won’t park, we will move as we listen. We will keep our bodies in motion as we hear and see. Come with me down to the corner of Burlington and we can cross the street. As you listen, walk with me along the other side of the street so you can get a good look at this big concrete structure and the colors and words and bodies painted on its side. This track should give you enough time to walk down along the Voxman building and then reverse the path back to our starting place….

						<span class='artist_name'>Jason Snell</span> is a multidisciplinary artist who performs electronic music with biosensors and builds generative art installations.
						<br>
						<br>
						His performances use biofeedback loops to explore consciousness and the line between cause and effect. His installations explore the nature of authorship, requiring the presence of visitors to generate the art. These projects use live data from the body and mind to compose music and visual sequences in real-time. The resulting compositions are biomorphic - taking the shape of life patterns - and reveal a natural intelligence inherent in the world and our bodies.
						<br>
						<br>
						Jason's work has been featured at Sundance, SXSW, CPH:DOX, the Berlin Independent, SF Independent, Slamdance, and Eufonia festivals, in TV and print news, and earned ADC, IAB, Webby, and Glaad Media awards.
						<br>
						<br>
						His brainwave and bio-sonification work has captured the attention of neuroscience and arts communities. He has presented and lectured throughout North America and Europe, including at NYU, MIT, Ableton, Native Instruments, University of Iowa, and scores of music and technology shows, conferences, and festivals.
						<br>
						<br>
						He founded the Newbo Synth Group, a monthly educational forum about synthesis. He studied at the University of Iowa, Minneapolis College of Art and Design, School of Visual Arts in New York, and attended technology-based art workshops at Spektrum in Berlin.
						<br>
						<br>
						Jason grew up in Iowa and spends his time between New York, Los Angeles, Iowa, and Berlin.
